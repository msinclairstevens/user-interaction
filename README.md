# User Interaction
Guidelines and strategies for designing positive user experience.

These notes are based on a materials I researched and presented in June, 1989. Many of the principles and guidelines have a foundation on Wilbert O. Galitz's 1985 book, _Handbook of Screen Format Design_. Although the appearance of tools has changed in the intervening years, I believe that the underlying principles are still applicable to how we think about and interact with our technologies.
