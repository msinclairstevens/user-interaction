#Guiding Principles of Course Development
Technical Training Courses Should
* be interactive (student-centered and focused on learning by doing)
* be goal-oriented
* teach the skills that the participants need when they return to their jobs
* build confidence

Strategies
* identify the goals of the course in concrete terms (behavioral objectives)
* communicate the goals of the course to the participants
* summarize each section by checking to see if the goals were achieved
* identify resources available to the participants to help them perform their tasks (documentation, online help system, reference material)
* replace lecture method with guided discussion (don't talk at the participants, talk with them)
* focus on what participants need to know, not what's nice to know
* design training material to be task and methodology oriented, not feature oriented
* show the end result before explaining how to build something
* keep reiterating how the pieces fit together
* employ standard conventions for naming things
* provide feedback (in the materials) so that participants have a self-check that they can use both in the training class and when they return to their jobs
